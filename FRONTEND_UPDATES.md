# Frontend Updates Summary

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. Articles Grouped by News Source
- Articles are now organized by their source (Air Cargo News, Air Cargo Week, STAT Times, etc.)
- Each source section has a clear header with the source name
- Articles within each source are displayed in a clean list format

### 2. Date Sorting (Newest First)
- Articles are sorted by `published_date` (newest first)
- Falls back to `created_at` if `published_date` is not available
- Sorting happens both on the backend (database query) and frontend (client-side)

### 3. Tag Filtering - Two Solutions

#### Solution 1: Category-Based Filtering (Default)
- Tags are automatically grouped into categories:
  - **主要主題** (Main Topics): 市場分析, 公司動態, 機場與基礎設施, etc.
  - **地理區域** (Geographic Regions): 亞洲, 歐洲, 北美, etc.
  - **公司/機場** (Companies/Airports): FedEx, DHL, WFS, etc.
  - **其他** (Others): Uncategorized tags
- Categories are collapsible/expandable
- Shows tag count per category
- Much easier to navigate than scrolling through 200+ tags

#### Solution 2: Search-Based Filtering
- Search input box to filter tags by keyword
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Shows only matching tags
- Perfect for finding specific tags quickly

#### Additional: "All Tags" View
- Traditional scrollable list of all tags
- Available as a third tab option
- Useful when you know exactly what you're looking for

2. **Database Query** (`app/database/supabase_client.py`):

   - Use Search tab to find specific tags
   - Use All tab for traditional list view
